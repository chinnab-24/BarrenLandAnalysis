# BarrenLandAnalysis
There is a farm of 400m by 600m where coordinates of the field are from (0, 0) to (399, 599). A portion of the farm is barren, and all the barren land is in the form of rectangles. Due to these rectangles of barren land, the remaining area of fertile land is in no particular shape. An area of fertile land is defined as the largest area of land that is not covered by any of the rectangles of barren land.  Input is a set of rectangles that contain the barren land. Output is all the fertile land area in square meters, sorted from smallest area to greatest
